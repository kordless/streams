### A New API Concept
Some people can visualize better than others. The ability to visualize a software application programming interface, or "API", varies from person to person. If you develop APIs for a living, you may or may not be able to see what the API call *looks* like in your mind's eye. For example, some might see boxes for the endpoints (/foobar) with arrows coming of of the boxes to point at more boxes representing a type of action (API) with more arrows to methods indicating use (API.add).

404 errors might show up as little road signs blinking warning.

When I think about APIs, I don't see anything like what I just described. Instead, I conceptualize API calls the same way I might observe something "in real time", such as the wires in one of those 100-in-1 electronics kits from my childhood. For me, method calls are simply the electricity buzzing on the wires to a request for "power" driven by me pushing a button. With APIs, this isn't so far off from the truth, given copper wires carry a lot of data for the Internet.

Unlike electricity running in wires, API and web calls tend to be a bit more "free" with the amounts of "power" or data they return for a given request. In fact, that's the whole idea behind "software is eating the world" models where "free" users click more buttons to make things "go viral" and hopefully build value. On the flip side, hard problems or hardware, deal with limits based on the reality in which we exist. When considering the problem holisticly, one starts to see that technology itself scales in varying ways and depends entirely on the medium in which it runs. For example, did you know compute speeds are increasing faster than network speeds because one relies on software more than the other?

The problem with the Web's "free" approach, in general, is that its not free. Companies who market to individuals end up providing greater amounts of service responses because they must balance the costs of delivering users needs with the stakeholder's expected return of investment in the company. In investment models like Facebook, the users naturally end up being unable to comprehend the cost of running the service for themselves and accepting or ignorant of the cost of altered behaviors including increase use of the product itself.

The current environment requires us to accept the risk of a free market model in exchange for new applications which aren't particularly suited to reliable performance and/or user experience. Direct examples include the various degrees in which user data is continuing to be lost to IN BULK to less trustworthy entities, including the ones that appear due to ignorance of the users.

It is my intent with Wisdom to create a new type of model for the infrastructure market which decouples the applications *running* the infrastructure from the risk of the applications *running on* the infrastructure. The whole premise is based on the assumption of applying payments to the calls related to infrastructure, which conveniently enough was predicted by 	

With microservice-type behaviors, companies visualize themselves focusing on the application creation process and the use of that application by the users. The ones that can do this efficiently provide better user experiences. By allowing someone else to run infrastructure in a trustworthy and predictable way, companies may find the development processes simpler and easier to manage. This was the general idea behind the 90's MSP models as well, where a customer focused on what the customer was good at and "let" the service provider take care of the details of *running* that thing for them for a rationalized cost.

The blockchain lends us a hand in this effort as well. With a given cryptocurrency blockchain, companies and individuals can quickly come to an agreement on the services provided and the cost of providing those services in a way that allows varying levels of trust, in as much as a federated system might allow.

### Implementation

### Operation

### Funding
Investment in infrastructure at this time is a horrible idea for multiple reasons. The infrastructure market itself is "dangerous" for risk takers at the moment given the consolidation and changes in market models driven by cloud technologies. Further, applying risk models to estimate the more "secure" infrastructure models appears to be at odds with the needs of the users and developers versus the needs of the stakeholders in the effort. In many cases the developers are the stakeholders, but scaling a project's contributers rarely keeps that true. 

In light of that conclusion, Wisdom now sets intent to bootstrap itself with a single founder's vision of rethinking the way revenue is coded. 

Today is the day we start to the moon!
